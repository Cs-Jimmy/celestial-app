# 🌌 Celestial App

> ✨ *Track your moods, log your thoughts, and visualize your journey — all wrapped in a nostalgic space aesthetic.*

## 💫 About the Project

**Celestial** is a **space-themed mental health, mood tracking, and journaling web app** built for the [CS Girlies Hackathon](https://csgirlies.devpost.com/).  
Developed entirely on **Replit** using an **AI agent (Claude AI)**, our team directed the AI through prompts, feature planning, and design choices — ensuring the final product reflects our creative vision allowing users to upload *moods*, reflect on their *feelings*, and access insightful *analytics* — all in a soft and cosmic user interface.
